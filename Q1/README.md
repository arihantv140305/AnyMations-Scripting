# Cosmology

I have assumed that vr is calculated by giving a specific standard deviation(500 in my case) and the standard deviation is same for all galaxies. Here the `plott` functions takes the maximum distance and the steo size as input an plots according to the number density of glaxies. Thorugh various plts I have shown how the velocity varies with number density and distance
